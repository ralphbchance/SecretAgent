Making Git repository of SecretAgentSupply.
Having  connection problems.

1. Problems was fixed by deleting local(git init info) and remote repositories
without deleting the contents of the local directory(SecretAgentSupply).
2. Change the name of the local directory(SecretAgentSupply) to SecretAgent.
3. git init for SecretAgent.
4. Created this README.txt file.
5. git add and git commit of the above file.
6. Went to github and set up remote repository(SecretAgent),then
followed their instructions to connect local and remote together!


As of February 26, 2018 all problems mention in original README.txt file 
$s been pushed to GitHub!
