Making Git repository of SecretAgentSupply.
Having  connection problems.

1. Problems was fixed by deleting local(git init info) and remote repositories
without deleting the contents of the local directory(SecretAgentSupply).
2. Change the name of the local directory to SecretAgent.
3. git init for SecretAgent
4. Created a README.txt file
5. git add and git commit of the above file
6. Went to github and set up remote repository(SecretAgent),then
followed their instructions to connect local and remote together!


New Problem via Windows 7 Notebook computer, trying resolve now.

Problem not resolved. The problem/remedy: Must enter username and passwood
for push from local to remote. One mo time to fix!
